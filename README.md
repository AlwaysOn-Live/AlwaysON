# Features
- Supports recording of audio and midi
- Recording will start automatically only if threshold (which can be determined) will be above X db for Y seconds. 
- Recording will continue as long as threshold is still above X, but with a time-window of Z secs- where even if the threshold is below X, it will continue (so it wonâ€™t just stop immediately on each pause)
- Once recording is completed (meaning threshold X has not reached for Z seconds) - the recording will be saved as a file
- The File is named automatically with date and time, and a prefix which can be modified
- The app will continue listening to the audio input for the next recording.
- You can set a few different input sources from the sound card, for each listener (mono or stereo) and define different values of X,Y,Z values.
